# React Portfolio
React Challenge - Module 20

## Description
This is a portfolio created with the react library. It is meant to showcase my work from previous projects and show that I can create my own website with React. I used the Styled Component package to make it more organized.

## Installation and Usage
The user can navigate through the various pages and click on projects to view them on another tab.

## Contributing
Carly Staheli and I worked on this entire project together. We are married and collaborated on it.
